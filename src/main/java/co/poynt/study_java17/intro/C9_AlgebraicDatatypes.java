    Algebraic datatypes

    For constructing composite datatypes from basic datatypes
       basic datatypes --> algebraic datatypes --> abstract datatypes --> object types
    In Java, algebraic datatypes are interfaces/classes with features restricted.

    Simpler than object types
      no encapsulation
      no extensibility
    They are transparent and predictable; what you see if what you get.
    Sometimes we just want simpler things.
